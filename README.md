# Introduction 
This is an open source project that is intended to help learn languages with a focus on speaking and hearing *over* reading and writing. We believe there are a few simple ways to make the early stages of learning a language much faster.

1.  A Focus on useful sentences: there will be initial memorization of base sentences that you will build off of. For example in lesson one you will learn the sentence "this is a house". Later you will extend vocabulary by adding adjectives "this is a black house" or small changes "this is my sisters house" and extend to more complex sentences "this is not my sisters black house". The repetition of learning a base sentence and modifying it gets you comfortable with speaking and hearing early on *over* memorizing large vocab lists.
2.  Thinking in the structure of the language you are learning. For examplse, in chinese the sentence "I am going to buy fruit tomorrow" is expressed as "I tomorrow buy fruit". We believe learning to think less in english and more in the language you're learning helps so we show sentences more literally and give you context of what the grammar structure means without the need to map sentences to perfect english.
3.  Focus on getting more repetition by reducing tedious exercises during learning phase. You'll improve more by moving quickly so you can recognize grammar patterns faster.
4.  Exposing you to "simple complexity" early. Giving you little snippets of different tenses and grammar structures early so you can gain some comfort before learning long, compound sentences (an anti-pattern of many learning systems is to do the easier initial learning with short sentences but have super verbose and long sentences later on when teaching new topics.)
5.  Obligatory comment about how we think learning is fun and yada yada yada.
