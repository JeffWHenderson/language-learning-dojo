Literally: “Something has all been given back to the teacher.”
Function: Used to indicate that everything that you’ve learnt has been forgotten.
Near-equivalent phrase in English: As far as I know, no real equivalent. “I’ve forgotten it all” would suffice as a reference translation. A native English speaker may say something like, “My French/mathematics/etc is a bit rusty” though this is not as strong as the original Chinese sentence.

25. A生了B的气。A shēng le B de qì.
